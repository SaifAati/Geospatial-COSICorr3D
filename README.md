![Alt text](Figs/WorkFlow.png?raw=true "Title")


# Installation and dependencies
--------------
To install `geoCosiCorr3D` from source:
### Option 1: 

1- Set and activate `geoCosiCorr3D` environment:

    conda env create --file geoCosiCorr3D.yml
    conda activate geoCosiCorr3D

2- Set shared libraries:

For Linux, you have to append the path to the [lib](https://github.com/SaifAati/geoCosiCorr3D/blob/main/geoCosiCorr3D/lib/) directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH in .bashrc to be able to use geoCosiCorr3D shared libraries,  
by adding the following line: 
    
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=~/geoCosiCorr3D/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH


Third party libraries and packages (optional):

1- Ames Stereo Pipeline ([ASP](https://github.com/NeoGeographyToolkit/StereoPipeline.git)) for WV1 and WV2 CCD correction using [wv_correct] : set the binary path of ASP in the configuration file ('geoConfig.py')


Note:

To update the `geoCosiCorr3D` env you can use the following cmd:

    conda env update --file geoCosiCorr3D.yml --prune

### Option 2: Docker


1- Build the image:

    docker-compose -f  docker-compose.yml build geocosicorr3d
2- Run a container:

    docker-compose -f  docker-compose.yml run geocosicorr3d

Note: To install docker in your machine follow the instrubction in this link https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
