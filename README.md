# Workflow

![Alt text](Figs/WorkFlow.png?raw=true "Title")

# Installation

There are two methods available to install `geoCosiCorr3D`: using Conda or Docker. Follow the instructions below based
on your preferred installation method.

## Option 1: Installing with Conda

1. To install using Conda, execute the following script in your terminal:
    ```bash
    ./install_cosicorr.sh --conda
    ```
   If Conda (or Miniconda) is not already installed on your machine, the script will attempt to install Miniconda
   automatically.
2. Once the installation is complete, you can activate the `geoCosiCorr3D` environment with:
    ```bash
    conda activate geoCosiCorr3D
    ```
   Alternatively, you can run Python scripts within the environment without activating it by using:
    ```bash
    conda run -n geoCosiCorr3D your_script.py
    ```
   Replace `your_script.py` with the name of the Python script you wish to run.

## Option 2: Installing with Docker

For Docker installation, execute the following command:

```bash
./install_cosicorr.sh --docker
```

This command will attempt to install Docker if it's not already installed on your system, start the Docker service, and
then pull the base `geoCosiCorr3D` Docker image. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to install software on your
system when using this option.

---

**Note:** Please follow these steps for a smooth installation process.
If you encounter any issues or need further assistance,
refer to the documentation (the documentation is still under construction üöß) or submit an issue on the project's GitHub
page.

### Important Note on Environment Variables

‚ö†Ô∏è Sometimes, environment variables are not automatically picked up and set during the installation process. To ensure the software operates correctly, it is recommended to manually set these variables. For example, to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable, you can use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<absolute_path_of_installation_directory>/Geospatial-COSICorr3D/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
Add this line to your .bashrc or .bash_profile (depending on your shell and OS) to make the change permanent:
```bash
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<absolute_path_of_installation_directory>/Geospatial-COSICorr3D/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
```

### <span style="color:blue">Batch Correlation</span>


The batch correlation feature allows performing correlation on multiple images in batch mode. It supports specifying lists of base and target images, with the script handling the correlation accordingly.

Comma-separated lists of base and target images can be passed, or wildcard patterns may be used to include all matching files in a directory.

### Options:
1. **Batch Correlation**
2. **Multiband Correlation** 

<details>
<summary>Batch Correlate Module Usage</summary>


**1- Serial Correlation:** 

```bash
python3 scripts/batch_correlation.py batch_correlate BASE_IMG_1.TIF,BASE_IMG_2.TIF TARGET_IMG_1.TIF,TARGET_IMG_2.TIF --output_path output/ --show --serialpython3 scripts/batch_correlation.py batch_correlate BASE_IMG_1.TIF,BASE_IMG_2.TIF "Target/*.TIF" --output_path output/ --show --all

```
**2- All Combinations Correlation:**
```bash
python3 scripts/batch_correlation.py batch_correlate BASE_IMG_1.TIF,BASE_IMG_2.TIF "Target/*.TIF" --output_path output/ --show --all
```
In these examples, the `--serial` option correlates images with the same index, while the `--all` option correlates all possible combinations of base and target images. If neither --serial nor --all is specified, the script defaults to --all.

**Note:** You can pass a comma-separated list of image paths or use a wildcard pattern like "folder/*.tif" to include all matching files in a directory.
</details>


<details>
<summary>Multiband Correlate Module Usage</summary>

The multiband correlation feature allows performing correlation between all possible bands in a given raster.
If the --band_combination option is specified, the correlation will be done between the specified bands.
```bash
python3 scripts/cosicorr.py multi_band_correlation input_img.TIF --band_combination "1,2;3,4" --output_path output/ --show
```   
</details>



### <span style="color:blue">Transform</span>

# geoCosiCorr3D: Time Series Analysis

## geoPCAIM [2]
Geospatial Principal Component Analysis-bases Inversion Method (geoPCAIM) is a statistically based approach
applied to a redundant surface displacement measurement
in order to filter out the measurement noise and extract the signal with the maximum spatio-temporal
coherence.
Horizontal displacement measurements obtained using the image correlation technique typically account 
for the surface deformation signal and several other artifacts such as decorrelation,
topography-related residuals, and stripe artifacts. 
Therefore, the main objective of this tool is to separate the deformation signal from the artifacts.
This approach can be considered as unsupervised learning,
for a **detailed description of this tool please read our research paper [2]**.

It should be noted that this approach does not imply smoothing the temporal variations of ground 
surface displacement. Instead, only local variations that do not correlate in space are filtered out.
In essence geoPCAIM approach could be used to reduce image geometry related artifacts (example Ridgecrest)
and to filter out the outliers over a time series of displacement (example Shisper).



## geoICA [1]
geoICA is a statistically based approach
applied to a redundant surface displacement measurement
in order to filter out the measurement noise and extract the signal with the maximum
spatio-temporal coherence. 
ICA decomposition is used rather than gepPCAIM in some cases because the sources of 
artifacts can be a major contribution to the data variance and could be filtered 
out by selecting only the first component of a geoPCAIM. 
The basis for the decomposition is that the deformation signal and the various sources
of artifacts can be assumed to be statistically independent sources. 
In particular, the artifacts are assumed to be statistically independent with 
the deformation signal. The deformation signal is presumed to be the same in all 
the 3-D measurements maps independent of the choice of a particular set of images. 
As a result, we expect the deformation signal to show in only one component. 
The hypothesis that the displacement signal is independent of the artifacts is
most likely to be verified in real applications. 
This assumption would be incorrect only in the unlikely case of a displacement 
signal similar with the pattern resulting from the geometric artifacts like
jitter or CCD artifacts.
