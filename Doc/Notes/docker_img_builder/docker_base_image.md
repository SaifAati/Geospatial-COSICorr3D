To build an image using a custom-named Dockerfile, use the `-f` or `--file` option with the `docker build` command:

```bash
docker build -t geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest -f geocosicorr3d_conda_py37.dockerfile . 
```

To create a container from the image
```bash
docker run -it --rm geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest /bin/bash
```

1. Save the Docker Image to a .tar Archive
```
docker save -o /path/to/save/location/geocosicorr3d_conda_py37.tar geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest
```

Here's a breakdown of the command:

- `-t geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest`: Tags the image with the name `geocosicorr3d_conda_py37` and version `latest`.
- `-f MyCustomDockerfile`: Specifies the Dockerfile to use for building the image.
- `.`: Indicates the build context (usually the current directory).

So, you can name your Dockerfile anything you want, but you just need to reference the custom name when you build your image.
Alright, it seems you want to create a Docker base image called `geoCosiCorr3D_conda_py37` which includes the provided Docker instructions. You can achieve this by following these steps:

1. Create a `Dockerfile` containing the Docker instructions you provided.
2. Build the Docker image using the Docker build command.
3. Tag the built image to give it a name and optionally a version.

Here's how you can do it:

### 1. Create a Dockerfile

First, save the provided Docker instructions into a file named `Dockerfile`.

### 2. Build the Docker image

Navigate to the directory containing the Dockerfile and run:

```bash
docker build -t geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest .
```

This command will build the Docker image using the instructions provided in the `Dockerfile`. The `-t` flag is used to tag the image with the name `geocosicorr3d_conda_py37` and version `latest`.

### 3. Verify the built image

After building the image, you can verify that it's correctly built by running:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see `geocosicorr3d_conda_py37` in the list of available images with the tag `latest`.

Now, you have successfully built and tagged the Docker image named `geoCosiCorr3D_conda_py37`.

If you plan to use this image as a base for other Docker images, you can reference it in other Dockerfiles using:

```Dockerfile
FROM geocosicorr3d_conda_py37:latest
```

This will use your `geoCosiCorr3D_conda_py37` image as the base image for any subsequent Docker instructions.

Note: Ensure you have Docker installed and running on your machine before executing these commands. If you face any issues or errors, feel free to share them for further assistance.
