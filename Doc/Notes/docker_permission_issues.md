# Docker Permission Issues on Ubuntu

If you're encountering permission issues while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket on Ubuntu, follow the steps below to troubleshoot and resolve the issue.

## 1. Check the Socket Permissions:

First, ensure that the socket permissions are as expected.

```bash
ls -l /var/run/docker.sock
```

You should see:

```
srw-rw---- 1 root docker 0 Jan  1 00:00 /var/run/docker.sock
```

## 2. Apply Permissions:

If the group is not `docker` or the permissions aren't set correctly, adjust them:

```bash
sudo chown root:docker /var/run/docker.sock
sudo chmod 660 /var/run/docker.sock
```

## 3. Activate Group Changes Without Logging Out:

Instead of logging out and back in after adding your user to the `docker` group, you can activate the group changes by using the `newgrp` command:

```bash
newgrp docker
```

Now, try running a Docker command.

## 4. Check Group Membership:

Ensure that your user is indeed a member of the `docker` group:

```bash
groups ${USER}
```

## 5. Check Docker Service Status:

Ensure that the Docker service is running:

```bash
sudo systemctl status docker
```

If it's not running, start it:

```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

## 6. Reboot the System:

Sometimes, a system reboot can help resolve permission issues. Try rebooting your system.

## 7. Manual Socket Interaction:

As a diagnostic step, try manually interacting with the Docker socket using `curl`:

```bash
curl --unix-socket /var/run/docker.sock http://localhost/_ping
```

This should return `OK` if the Docker daemon is responsive.

If you've tried all the above steps and are still facing issues, consult system logs, Docker service logs, or Docker's official documentation and forums for further insights.
